However, the answer could be more informative and provide additional context.\n\nImproved answer: Centuries ago, people used their knowledge of the stars to navigate ships, particularly in open seas where there were no landmarks to guide them. By observing the position of stars and constellations, sailors could determine their latitude and direction, allowing them to reach their destinations safely.",
