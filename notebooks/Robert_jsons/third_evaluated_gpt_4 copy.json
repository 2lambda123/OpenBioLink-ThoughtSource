She reports that she developed painful left-sided leg swelling and redness earlier in the day. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. She denies any recent prolonged travel. She experienced a similar episode affecting the opposite leg one year ago and was diagnosed with a thrombus in the right femoral vein. On examination, the left leg is erythematous and swollen. Passive dorsiflexion of the left ankle elicits pain in the left calf. Ultrasound of the leg reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. A genetic workup reveals that she has an inherited condition. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",

This would allow for increased blood flow to vital organs and help maintain blood pressure despite the reduced blood volume. \n\nTherefore, the most likely decreased value in this patient compared to a healthy adult is systemic vascular resistance (A).",

The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
