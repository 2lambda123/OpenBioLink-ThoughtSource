Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used to treat sickle cell anemia. So, what does hydroxyurea do to the hemoglobin physiology of these patients?\n\nA) Increases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin - This is not correct. Hydroxyurea does not directly increase the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin.\n\nB) Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin - This is not correct. Hydroxyurea does not directly decrease the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin.\n\nC) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) - This is correct. Hydroxyurea can increase the levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) in patients with sickle cell anemia. HgbF is a type of hemoglobin that is normally present in fetuses and newborns, but it decreases as we age. HgbF does not sickle, so increasing its levels can help prevent sickling of red blood cells in patients with sickle cell anemia.\n\nD) Decreases levels of HgbS - This is correct. Hydroxyurea can decrease the levels of HgbS in patients with sickle cell anemia. This is because hydroxyurea can stimulate the production of HgbF, which can replace some of the HgbS in the patient's red blood cells.\n\nE) Decreases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) - This is not correct. Hydroxyurea can actually increase the levels of HgbF in patients with sickle cell anemia, as mentioned in option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) and D) Decreases levels of HgbS.",

Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used to treat sickle cell anemia. So, what does hydroxyurea do to the hemoglobin physiology of these patients?\n\nA) Increases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin - This is not correct. Hydroxyurea does not directly increase the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin.\n\nB) Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin - This is not correct. Hydroxyurea does not directly decrease the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin.\n\nC) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) - This is correct. Hydroxyurea can increase the levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) in patients with sickle cell anemia. HgbF is a type of hemoglobin that is normally present in fetuses and newborns, but it decreases as we age. HgbF does not sickle, so increasing its levels can help prevent sickling of red blood cells in patients with sickle cell anemia.\n\nD) Decreases levels of HgbS - This is correct. Hydroxyurea can decrease the levels of HgbS in patients with sickle cell anemia. This is because hydroxyurea can stimulate the production of HgbF, which can replace some of the HgbS in the patient's red blood cells.\n\nE) Decreases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) - This is not correct. Hydroxyurea can actually increase the levels of HgbF in patients with sickle cell anemia, as mentioned in option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) and D) Decreases levels of HgbS.",

So, option A is also a possible answer.\n\nOption B, setting out to sea, is not a good choice if the sailor wants to reach the shore. It would take them further away from their destination.\n\nOption D, taking the afternoon off, is not a good choice either, as it would not help the sailor reach the shore.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is either A or C, depending on the situation and the sailor's preferences.",
