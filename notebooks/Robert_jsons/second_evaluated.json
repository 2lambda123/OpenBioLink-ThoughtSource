This is different from Bipolar I disorder, which involves more severe manic episodes, and Cyclothymic disorder, which involves milder mood swings. Persistent depressive disorder and Schizoaffective disorder are less likely based on the information provided. Therefore, the answer is B) Bipolar II disorder.",
