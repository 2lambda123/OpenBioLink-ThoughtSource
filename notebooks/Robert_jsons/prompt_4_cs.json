So, this could be a correct answer.\n\nC) Sweating - Sweating is a natural response to physical activity and does not necessarily stop someone from running. So, this is not the correct answer.\n\nD) Exhaustion - Exhaustion can suddenly stop someone when they are running, as their body becomes too tired to continue.

However, the answer could be more comprehensive and informative. \n\nImproved answer: As men get older, their hair often begins to thin out and may fall out, leading to a receding hairline. This process is typically caused by a combination of genetics and hormonal changes, such as the increased production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which can cause hair follicles to shrink and produce thinner, weaker hairs.",
