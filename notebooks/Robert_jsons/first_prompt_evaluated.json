The mutation in these patients results in the production of HgbS, which causes the sickling of red blood cells. Hydroxyurea is a treatment for sickle cell anemia, so it must have an effect on HgbS. The answer choices are:\n\nA) Increases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin\nB) Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin\nC) Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)\nD) Decreases levels of HgbS\nE) Decreases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)\n\nOption A is incorrect because hydroxyurea does not increase the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin. Option B is also incorrect because hydroxyurea does not decrease the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin. Option C is partially correct because hydroxyurea can increase the levels of fetal hemoglobin, which can help reduce the sickling of red blood cells. However, the question specifically asks about the direct effects of hydroxyurea on HgbS, not HgbF. Option E is incorrect because hydroxyurea does not decrease the levels of fetal hemoglobin.\n\nTherefore,",

The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

This is a key characteristic of bipolar disorder. However, the question also provides additional information that can help narrow down the specific type of bipolar disorder. \n\nBipolar I disorder is characterized by at least one manic episode, which is a distinct period of abnormally elevated or irritable mood that lasts at least one week. The patient in this question only reports occasional episodes of elevated mood, which may not meet the criteria for a full manic episode. Therefore, Bipolar I disorder is less likely.\n\nBipolar II disorder is characterized by at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, which is a less severe form of mania that lasts at least four consecutive days. The patient in this question reports several periods of depressed mood that resolve after 4-6 weeks, which could be considered major depressive episodes. She also reports occasional episodes of elevated mood, which could be considered hypomanic episodes. Therefore, Bipolar II disorder is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nCyclothymic disorder is a milder form of bipolar disorder that involves numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a full hypomanic or major",
