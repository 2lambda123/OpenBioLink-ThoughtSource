She has a history of preterm birth. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate 100/min; respiratory rate 13/min; and temperature 36.6\u2103 (97.9\u2109). The pelvic examination reveals cervical softening and shortening. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a cervical length of 12 mm, which is consistent with preterm labor. A tocolytic and a single dose of betamethasone are administered. Betamethasone stimulates which fetal cells?",
