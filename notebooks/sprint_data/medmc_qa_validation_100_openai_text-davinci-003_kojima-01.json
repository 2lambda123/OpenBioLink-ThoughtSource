Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition* Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a m-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinephrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.* Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as duloxetine and venlafaxine.* Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic propey through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the m opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake.* These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain."

Glycopyrrolate is twice as potent and longer acting quaternary antimuscarinic which does not produce central effects. Antisecretory action is more marked than atropine and tachycardia is less marked.

Instead, it becomes a fibrotic non-vital mass, meaning that it is no longer alive and is replaced by fibrous tissue. \n\nResorption of the roots is initiated from the inner surface of the roots, not from the dental pulp. \n\nFinally, the dental pulp does not aid in the formation of secondary dentin, which is a type of dentin that forms in response to injury or trauma. Instead, it slows down the resorption of the roots. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) Aids in formation of secondary dentin slowing down resorption.",

These granules are actively secretory and thus distinct from classical lysosomes.\u00a0\nNeutrophils have two main types of granules:\n\nThe smaller specific (or secondary) granules contain lysozyme, collagenase, gelatinase, lactoferrin, plasminogen activator, histaminase, and alkaline phosphatase.\u00a0\nThe larger azurophil (or primary) granules contain MPO, bactericidal factors (such as defensins), acid hydrolases, and a variety of neutral proteases (elastase, cathepsin G, nonspecific collagenases, proteinase 3).\n\nKumar V, Abbas AK, Aster JC.
