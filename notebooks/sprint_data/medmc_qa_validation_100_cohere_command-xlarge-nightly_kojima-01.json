Glycogen synthesisLow insulin to glucagon ratio implies a catabolic state, i.e. usage of body stores to form energy, typically seen in fasting state ancl diabetes mellitus. Hence, this state will promote glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis as well as ketone body formation, while at the same time inhibiting glycogen synthesis and storage."

Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition* Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a m-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinephrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.* Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as duloxetine and venlafaxine.* Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic propey through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the m opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake.* These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain."

Ganong 25Ie p419, 425, 24Ie p427)Prior to initiating treatment for a couple, in whom the man has azoospermia, it is impoant to distinguish whether the lack of sperm in the ejaculate is from an obstructive or non-obstructive process.The presence of normal volume testes with bilaterally indurated epididymis and/or absent vas deferens will point to an obstructive etiology for azoospermia.A history of cryptorchidism in the presence of small or soft testes suggests non-obstructive azoospermia, especially if associated with an elevated serum (FSH) level.A decreased spermatogenesis leads to decrease in production of inhibin, which causes an elevation in FSH."
