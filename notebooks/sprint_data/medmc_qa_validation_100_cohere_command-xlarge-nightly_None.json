Glycogen synthesisLow insulin to glucagon ratio implies a catabolic state, i.e. usage of body stores to form energy, typically seen in fasting state ancl diabetes mellitus. Hence, this state will promote glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis as well as ketone body formation, while at the same time inhibiting glycogen synthesis and storage."

(The last day for scan is 13 weeks and 6 days pregnant.)Triple marker test is performed in pregnant women at the end of first trimester and the beginning of the second trimester.The anomaly scan, also sometimes called the anatomy scan, 20 week ultrasound, or level 2 ultrasound, is a pregnancy ultrasound performed between 18-22 weeksA growth scan is an ultrasound scan that determines whether your baby's growth is normal. Doctors typically recommend it for women during the third trimester of pregnancy; one of the reasons it is also a fetal growth scan between 28 weeks and 32 weeks of pregnancy."

In addition, -PCR with genetic sequencing can distinguish among rabies virus variants, permitting identification of the probable source of an infection.\"-Harrison 19/e p1302.Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing can be used to amplify pas of a rabies virus genome from fixed or unfixed brain tissue or saliva. Sequencing of amplified products can allow identification of the infecting virus strain."

It is caused by antibodies in the donor's blood that react with proteins on the surface of the patient's cells, leading to inflammation and damage to the lungs. The risk of TRALI is highest with the first transfusion of blood components, and it is more common in women than in men. Symptoms of TRALI include difficulty breathing, chest pain, and fever. Treatment includes supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and medications to reduce inflammation.\nA patient with Hb 7 was to be transfused with 2 packs of blood.

Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition* Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a m-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinephrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.* Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as duloxetine and venlafaxine.* Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic propey through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the m opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake.* These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain."

When inhalation anaesthetic are given they inhibit the ciliary function therefore secretions in the respiratory pathway are not removed so we have to stop the secretions by administration of anti cholinergic drugs like atropine or glycopyrrolate. Glycopyrrolate is twice as potent and longer acting quaternary antimuscarinic which does not produce central effects. Antisecretory action is more marked than atropine and tachycardia is less marked. It acts rapidly when given i.v. and is the preferred antimuscarinic in anaesthetic practice."

Ganong 25Ie p419, 425, 24Ie p427)Prior to initiating treatment for a couple, in whom the man has azoospermia, it is impoant to distinguish whether the lack of sperm in the ejaculate is from an obstructive or non-obstructive process.The presence of normal volume testes with bilaterally indurated epididymis and/or absent vas deferens will point to an obstructive etiology for azoospermia.A history of cryptorchidism in the presence of small or soft testes suggests non-obstructive azoospermia, especially if associated with an elevated serum (FSH) level.A decreased spermatogenesis leads to decrease in production of inhibin, which causes an elevation in FSH."

Spikes Slow waves: - Most gastro intestinal contractions occur rhythmically & this rhythm is determined mainly by frequency of 'slow waves' - These are not action potentials, instead they are slow undulating changes in resting membrane potential - These waves are caused by complex interactions among smooth muscle cells & interstitial cells of cajal. - Slow waves usually do not themselves cause muscle contraction (except in stomach) instead they mainly excite appearance of intermittent spike potential & spike potentials in turn actually excite muscle contraction. Parasympathetic neurons - depolarize smooth muscle cell & makes muscle fibers more excitable. Smooth muscle contraction occurs in response to entry of calcium ions into muscle fiber.

The auriculotemporal nerve provides postganglionic parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland, while the sympathetic fibers in this nerve provide vasomotor innervation to the sweat glands in the skin of the parotid gland.\n\nThe correct answer is B) Preganglionic parasympathetic fibre relay in Otic ganglion.",
