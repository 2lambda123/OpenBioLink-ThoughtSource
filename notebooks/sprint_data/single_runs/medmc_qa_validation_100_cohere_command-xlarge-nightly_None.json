                    "Leakage of CSF into the nose is called CSF rhinorrhea. It may be clear fluid or mixed with blood as in acute head injuries. TRAUMA. Most of the cases follow trauma.it can be accidental or surgical. Inflammation, mucoceles of sinuses, sinunasal polyposis, fungal infection of sinuses & osteomyelitis, can all erode the bone and dura. Neoplasms, idiopathic- where cause is unknown and patient has spontaneous leak. SITE OF Leakage- CSF from anterior cranial fossa reaches the nose (1) cribriform plate, (2) roof of ethmoid air cells or (3) frontal sinus. CSF from middle cranial fossa follows injuries to sphenoid sinus, cribriform plate. In fracture of temporal bone, CSF reaches the middle ear and then escapes through the Eustachian tube into the nose (CSF OTORHINORRHOEA) DIAGNOSIS- there is history of clear watery discharge from the nose on bending the head or straining. CSF rhinorrhea should be differentiated from nasal discharge as the former is sudden, gushes in drops when bending and cannot be sniffed back. CSF rhinorrhea after head trauma is mixed with blood and shows \"target sign\" when collected on filter paper.it shows central red spot and peripheral lighter halo sign. LAB TEST = BETA-2 transferrin is seen in CSF and not in the nasal discharge. its presence is a specific and sensitive test."

                    "Kilovoltage:\nThe optimal operating potential of dental X-ray units is between 60 and 70 kVp (ADA 2012).\nAlthough image diagnosis may be improved slightly with increased image contrast (low kVp) images, the patient dose is reduced with higher kVp exposures. Most intraoral machines use 60 to 70 kVp. The availability of constant-potential (fully rectified), high-frequency or direct current (DC)\u00a0dental X-ray units have made possible the production of radiographs with lower kilovoltage and at reduced levels of radiation. The surface exposure required to produce a comparable radiographic density using a constant-potential unit is approximately 25% less than that of a conventional self-rectified unit operating at the same kilovoltage. At the present time, several manufacturers produce DC units.\nThus, in intraoral radiograph, patient radiation is not decreased by decreasing kVp.\n\u00a0Reference: White and Pharoah's Oral Radiology Principles and Interpretation 7th edition page no 36"

It is placed in series between the muscle fibers and the\u00a0 tendon. Golgi tendon organ is formed by a group of nerve endings covered by a connective tissue capsule.\nNERVE SUPPLY TO GOLGI TENDON ORGAN\nSensory nerve fiber supplying the Golgi tendon organ belongs to Ib type. The nerve fiber supplying Golgi tendon organ ramifies into many branches. Each branch ends in the form of a knob.\u00a0\nFUNCTIONS OF GOLGI TENDON ORGAN\nGolgi tendon organ gives response to the change in the force or tension developed in the skeletal muscle during contraction. It is also the receptor for inverse stretch reflex and lengthening reaction and thereby prevents damage of muscle due to overstretching."

                    "The killing of microbes and the destruction of ingested materials are accomplished by reactive oxygen species (ROS, also called reactive oxygen intermediates), reactive nitrogen species, mainly derived from nitric oxide (NO), and lysosomal enzymes.\nNeutrophils and monocytes contain granules packed with enzymes and anti-microbial proteins that degrade microbes and dead tissues and may contribute to tissue damage. These granules are actively secretory and thus distinct from classical lysosomes.\u00a0\nNeutrophils have two main types of granules:\n\nThe smaller specific (or secondary) granules contain lysozyme, collagenase, gelatinase, lactoferrin, plasminogen activator, histaminase, and alkaline phosphatase.\u00a0\nThe larger azurophil (or primary) granules contain MPO, bactericidal factors (such as defensins), acid hydrolases, and a variety of neutral proteases (elastase, cathepsin G, nonspecific collagenases, proteinase 3).\n\nKumar V, Abbas AK, Aster JC.

Internal carotid aery is not ligated in case of epistaxis control, as it is the msinvessel supplying the central nervous system.\"Endoscopy identifies the source of posterior epistaxis in over 80 percent of the cases. Ligation should be performed as close as possible to the likely bleeding point. Thus the hierarchy of ligation is: Sphenopalatine aery; internal maxillary aery; external carotid aery; anterior/posterior ethmoidal aery."
