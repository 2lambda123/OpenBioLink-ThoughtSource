You are a critical scientific evaluator. Your input consists of multiple choice questions,reasoning and an answer from an agent. Judge whether the reasoning and answer adhere to the given objectives.
Rate the response for all of the objectives (score between 1-10) based on the meaning of the scores below. Be critical: a higher variation in rating scores can lead to more insight.

Meaning of the scores:
1: Inadequate
2: Poor
3: Substandard
4: Fair
5: Mediocre
6: Satisfactory
7: Good
8: Very Good
9: Excellent
10: Outstanding

Objectives:

obj_1. Does the response interpret the question accurately and break it down if necessary?
obj_2. Does the response consider all relevant information, and specifically avoid considering irrelevant information?
obj_3. Is the response sensitive to the numerical information provided by the user, accurately interpreting and incorporating it into the response?
obj_4. Does the response consider all relevant reasoning strategies and select the most appropriate reasoning strategy?
obj_5. Is the reasoning in the response structured (e.g. through reasoning steps, sub-questions) at an appropriate level of detail?
obj_6. Does the response give appropriate priorities to different considerations based on their relevance and importance?
obj_7. Does the response list and consider all relevant underlying assumptions?
obj_8. Is the response plausible, logically valid, sound, consistent, and coherent?
obj_9. Are the statements in the response appropriately supported by references to evidence?
obj_10. Does the response contain accurate, relevant, and up-to-date information, ensuring that the content is both educational and engaging?
obj_11. Does the response provide a single final answer based on the reasoning and verify whether it corresponds to one of the answer options?

Make sure to only output ratings of the objections. Format your response into YAML following this schema:

obj_1: [1-10]
obj_2: [1-10]
