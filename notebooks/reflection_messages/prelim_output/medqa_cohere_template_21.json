Today, he reports body aches, headache, and fever along with this chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for prediabetes, which he controls with exercise and diet. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. His blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse rate is 90/min, temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.5\u00b0F), and respiratory rate is 18/min. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilateral, a barrel-shaped chest, and measured breathing through pursed lips. A chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation. Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%.

He was diagnosed with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. At the present time, he is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. A sputum sample is sent for culture and the patient is started on vancomycin.The pediatrician tells the patient\u2019s family that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree which increases the patient's chances of future infections. He will have to undergo chest physiotherapy and they should report any signs of infection immediately to a medical professional. Which of the following pathogens will most likely infect this patient in adulthood?",

He also stated that he used to have \u2018high blood sugars\u2019 when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive.

Due to this reason she mostly avoids eating. She says she has lost a few pounds in the last couple of months. She is a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. Past medical history is insignificant except for chronic knee pain, for which she takes over the counter painkillers. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 120/89 mm Hg.

She states that she feels as though her \u201clungs are falling apart,\u201d noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from \u201crandom\u201d bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, \u201cYes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.\u201d She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being \u201cglove-finger shadows\u201d (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated.

Over the past week, she has been projectile vomiting after most feedings. Initially, the vomiting would occur just once or twice a day, but now it occurs after every feed. However, her appetite hasn\u2019t decreased, and she seeks milk right after each episode of vomiting. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is breastfed exclusively. On physical exam, the vital signs include: temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg, respiratory rate 28/min, and heart rate 150/min. On examination, she appears to be mildly dehydrated, listless, and irritable. Her abdomen is soft and nontender with a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. Which of the following acid-base disturbances is most likely associated with this patient\u2019s condition?",

Her height and weight are appropriate for her age, and she is up to date on all her vaccinations and has no medical complaints. She is doing well in school and has a part-time job stocking shelves at a clothing store. She was offered a higher-paying job as a cashier at the store, but she declined. She is very shy and withdrawn with the physician. Afterwards, her mother asks to speak to the physician alone and expresses concern that her daughter is very socially isolated and feels lonely. She is also worried that her daughter is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family. The daughter is interested in art and music, but hasn\u2019t participated in any extracurriculars because she says that she is untalented and thinks nobody wants to hang out with her. When her mother has encouraged her to invite friends over, the daughter bursts into tears and says, \u201cNobody wants to be friends with me, I am too lame and ugly and I just know I\u2019ll end up getting rejected.\u201d Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the daughter\u2019s behavior?",

She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",

It then ascends on the left side of the neck to the left of the common carotid artery and enters the left side of the jugulosquamous sinus. It opens into the left lymph duct, which opens in the left internal jugular vein just above the left subclavian vein. The thoracic duct receives lymph from most of the body, with the exception of the right upper limb, which is drained by the right lymphatic duct. The thoracic duct also receives lymph from the left upper limb, the left lower limb, and the left side of the head and neck.",

Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?",
