She reports that she developed painful left-sided leg swelling and redness earlier in the day. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. She denies any recent prolonged travel. She experienced a similar episode affecting the opposite leg one year ago and was diagnosed with a thrombus in the right femoral vein. On examination, the left leg is erythematous and swollen. Passive dorsiflexion of the left ankle elicits pain in the left calf. Ultrasound of the leg reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. A genetic workup reveals that she has an inherited condition. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",

They have used fertility monitors and other aids without success. A hysterosalpingogram in his wife was normal. The patient has a history of cleft lip and recurrent upper respiratory infections as a child. He was briefly hospitalized for severe pneumonia when he was 9-years-old. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/85 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, he is a healthy-appearing male in no acute distress with fully developed reproductive organs.

We can do this by multiplying the prevalence of the disease in the general population by the chance that any one person in the general population has the disease.\n\n1/100 x 1/2 = 1/200\n\nSo, there is a 1/200 chance that the husband is a carrier for the disease.\n\nNext, we need to determine the chance that the wife is a carrier for the disease. We can do this by multiplying the prevalence of the disease in people with the disease by the chance that any one person with the disease has the disease.\n\n1/100 x 1/2 = 1/200\n\nSo, there is a 1/200 chance that the wife is a carrier for the disease.\n\nNow, we need to determine the chance that both the husband and the wife are carriers for the disease. We can do this by multiplying the chance that the husband is a carrier by the chance that the wife is a carrier.\n\n1/200 x 1/200 = 1/400,000\n\nSo, there is a 1/400,000 chance that both the husband and the wife are carriers for the disease.\n\nFinally, we need to determine the chance that the child will have the disease. We can do this by multiplying the chance that both the husband and the wife are carriers by the chance that any one child of two carriers will have the disease.\n\n1/400,000 x 1/4 = 1/100,000\n\nSo, there is a 1/100,000 chance that the child will have the disease.\n\nNow, we need to convert this to a percentage. We can do this by multiplying the chance that the child will have the disease by 100.\n\n1/100,000 x 100 = 1/10\n\nSo, the chance that the child will have the disease is 1/10.",
