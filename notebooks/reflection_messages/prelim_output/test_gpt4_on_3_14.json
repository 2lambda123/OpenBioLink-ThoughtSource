A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?",

This rules out CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes, as they require activation and priming before they can lyse abnormal cells. It also rules out bone marrow-derived macrophages and band neutrophils, as they require opsonization before they can phagocytose and lyse abnormal cells.\n\nThe correct answer is therefore D) Natural killer cells. Natural killer cells are able to recognize and lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation.

Interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 are not typically associated with eosinophil recruitment. Platelet activating factor can recruit eosinophils, but it is not as strongly associated with eosinophil recruitment as immunoglobulin E and leukotriene D4.\n\nStep 4: Choose the answer choice that is most strongly associated with eosinophil recruitment.

The blisters and positive Nikolsky\u2019s sign indicate a blistering disease. The age of the patient (7-day-old newborn) and the diffuse erythema suggest a neonatal onset. \n\nThe most likely diagnosis in this patient is scalded skin syndrome (B), which is caused by exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. The disease is characterized by diffuse erythema, flaccid blisters, and desquamation of the skin, which can be induced by gentle pressure (positive Nikolsky\u2019s sign). The disease is more common in neonates and young children and can be associated with fever, irritability, and other systemic symptoms. \n\nScarlet fever (A) is a bacterial infection caused by group A Streptococcus, which can cause a diffuse erythematous rash, but it does not typically present with blisters or desquamation. \n\nImpetigo (C) is a bacterial skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, which can present with vesicles or pustules, but it does not typically cause diffuse erythema or blisters. \n\nErysipela (D) is a bacterial skin infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, which can cause a well-demarcated erythematous rash with raised borders, but it does not typically present with blisters or desquamation. \n\nPyoderma (E) is a general term for any bacterial skin infection that involves pus formation, but it does not specify the type of lesion or the causative organism.",
