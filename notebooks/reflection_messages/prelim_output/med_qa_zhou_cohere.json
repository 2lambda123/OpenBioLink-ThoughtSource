He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have \u2018high blood sugars\u2019 when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive. Which of the following is the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram?",

                "question": "Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?",
