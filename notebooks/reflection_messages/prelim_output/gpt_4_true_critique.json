A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?",

She has projectile vomiting after most feedings and a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. These findings are suggestive of pyloric stenosis, a condition in which the opening between the stomach and the small intestine (the pylorus) becomes narrowed, causing obstruction and vomiting.\n\nStep 2: Determine the acid-base disturbance associated with the condition\nPyloric stenosis leads to persistent vomiting, which results in the loss of gastric acid (hydrochloric acid). This loss of acid leads to a decrease in hydrogen ions (H+) in the body, causing an increase in bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) and a subsequent increase in blood pH. This is known as metabolic alkalosis.\n\nStep 3: Choose the correct answer\nBased on the information above, the most likely acid-base disturbance associated with this patient's condition is metabolic alkalosis (C).",

These symptoms suggest a possible hemolytic anemia.\n\n2. The physical examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae, and the spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. This indicates that the patient has an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), which is often seen in hemolytic anemias.\n\n3. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl, which is low, and his mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell, which is within the normal range. This suggests that the anemia is not due to a lack of hemoglobin production but rather to an increased destruction of red blood cells.\n\n4. The Coombs test is negative, which means that the hemolytic anemia is not caused by an autoimmune process.\n\n5. The peripheral blood smear is not shown, but we can assume that it shows signs of hemolysis, such as fragmented red blood cells or spherocytes.\n\nBased on this information, the patient is most likely experiencing a hemolytic anemia, possibly due to a recent infection. Now let's consider the possible complications listed in the answer choices:\n\nA) Malaria - This is a parasitic infection that can cause hemolytic anemia, but there is no indication that the patient has been exposed to malaria or has any risk factors for this disease.\n\nB) Acute myelogenous leukemia - This is a type of blood cancer that can cause anemia, but it is not typically associated with hemolytic anemia or the patient's symptoms.\n\nC) Cholecystitis - This is inflammation of the gallbladder, which can be a complication of hemolytic anemia due to the increased production of bilirubin and the formation of gallstones. This is a possible complication for this patient.\n\nD) Renal papillary necrosis - This is a rare condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including hemolytic anemia. However, it is not the most likely complication for this patient.\n\nE) Splenic sequestration crisis - This is a complication of hemolytic anemia in which the spleen suddenly enlarges and traps a large number of red blood cells, leading to a rapid drop in hemoglobin levels. This is a possible complication for this patient, especially given",

The patient's laboratory results show elevated total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT, which further supports the presence of a liver problem.\n3. The patient has negative hepatitis B and C tests, so viral hepatitis is not the cause of her liver problem.\n4. Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows mildly increased echogenicity of the liver, which can be seen in various liver diseases.\n\nNow let's analyze the answer choices:\n\nA) Inferior vena cava thrombosis: This is not a common finding in liver diseases and does not explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.\n\nB) Cutaneous xanthomas: These are deposits of cholesterol in the skin and can be seen in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), both of which can cause the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.\n\nC) Butterfly-shaped vertebrae: This is a finding in Alagille syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the liver, heart, and other organs. However, this syndrome typically presents in childhood, not in a 57-year-old woman.\n\nD) Increased CA 19-9 levels: CA 19-9 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in some cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more suggestive of a non-malignant liver disease.\n\nE) Kayser-Fleischer rings: These are copper deposits in the cornea and are a characteristic finding in Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder that causes copper accumulation in the liver and other organs. However, Wilson's disease typically presents in younger patients and would not explain the patient's negative hepatitis tests.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and age, the most likely additional finding in this patient is cutaneous xanthomas (choice B). This suggests that the patient may have primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), both of which can cause the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.",
