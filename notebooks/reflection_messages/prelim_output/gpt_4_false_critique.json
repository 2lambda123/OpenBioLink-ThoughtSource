On examination, a thyroid nodule was present; the nodule was fixed, immobile, and non-tender. Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule with a size of 2 cm. Histological examination of a fine needle biopsy was performed and cytological examination reported a likely suspicion of neoplasia. CT scan is performed to check for any lesions in the bones and/or lungs, common metastatic sites in this condition. Treatment with radioiodine therapy is planned after near-total thyroidectomy. Considering this tumor, which of the following is the most likely initial metastatic site in this patient?",

The patient presents with infertility, a history of cleft lip, recurrent upper respiratory infections, and an abnormal cardiac auscultation. These symptoms suggest a possible genetic disorder affecting multiple organ systems.\n\nNow let's go through the answer choices and see which class of proteins could be responsible for these symptoms:\n\nA) Microtubule monomeric protein: These proteins are involved in the formation of microtubules, which are essential for cell division and intracellular transport. While mutations in these proteins could potentially lead to some developmental abnormalities, they are not specifically associated with the symptoms presented by the patient.\n\nB) Lysosomal trafficking regulator protein: These proteins are involved in the transport of materials within lysosomes, which are cellular organelles responsible for breaking down waste materials and cellular debris. Mutations in these proteins can lead to lysosomal storage diseases, which typically present with a wide range of symptoms, including developmental abnormalities and organ dysfunction. However, the patient's symptoms do not specifically point to a lysosomal storage disease.\n\nC) Transmembrane ion channel protein: These proteins are involved in the transport of ions across cell membranes, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper cell function. Mutations in these proteins can lead to a variety of disorders, including cystic fibrosis, which is characterized by recurrent respiratory infections and infertility in males. However, the patient's other symptoms, such as cleft lip and abnormal cardiac auscultation, are not typically associated with cystic fibrosis.\n\nD) Retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein: These proteins are involved in the transport of materials along the cytoskeleton in a retrograde (toward the cell body) direction. Mutations in these proteins can lead to a variety of disorders, including some forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia, which is characterized by progressive muscle stiffness and weakness. However, the patient's symptoms do not specifically point to a disorder involving retrograde cytoskeletal motor proteins.\n\nE) Anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein: These proteins are involved in the transport of materials along the cytoskeleton in an anterograde (away from the cell body) direction. Mutations in these proteins can lead to a variety of disorders, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which is characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, infertility in males, and situs inversus (abnormal positioning of internal organs).

Additionally, her history of smoking and occasional alcohol use are risk factors for peptic ulcers.\n\nB) Choledocholithiasis - This condition involves gallstones in the bile duct, which typically presents with right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and fever. The patient's symptoms do not match this presentation.\n\nC) Pancreatitis - This condition typically presents with severe, constant abdominal pain that radiates to the back, along with nausea and vomiting. The patient's symptoms do not match this presentation.\n\nD) Gastric peptic ulcer - This is a possibility, but gastric ulcers typically cause pain immediately after eating, whereas the patient's pain occurs mostly after meals and subsides several hours after eating. This makes a duodenal peptic ulcer more likely.\n\nE) Gallbladder cancer - This is a rare condition and typically presents with right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and weight loss. The patient's symptoms do not match this presentation.\n\nBased on the patient's symptoms and risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is A) Duodenal peptic ulcer.",

She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",

Additionally, a tumor would likely have been seen on the recent CT scan.\nC) Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency - This could cause nystagmus and ataxia, but it would not typically cause adduction deficits, painful double vision, or disc hyperemia.\nD) Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit - This could cause painful double vision and disc hyperemia, but it would not typically cause adduction deficits or nystagmus.

In the case of ovarian cancer, the sentinel nodes are usually located in the pelvic region.\n\n2. Lumbar trunks: The lymph from the pelvic region drains into the lumbar trunks. Since the patient is an Asian woman, it is more likely that the cancer cells would have spread to the left lumbar trunk.\n\n3. Cisterna chyli: The left lumbar trunk drains into the cisterna chyli, which is a large sac-like structure that collects lymph from the lower half of the body.\n\n4. Thoracic duct: The cisterna chyli continues as the thoracic duct, which is the largest lymphatic vessel in the body. It carries lymph from the lower half of the body and the left side of the upper body.\n\n5. Left subclavian vein: The thoracic duct empties into the left subclavian vein, which is a large vein that carries blood from the upper extremity and thoracic region back to the heart.\n\n6. Systemic circulation: Once the cancer cells have entered the left subclavian vein, they can travel through the systemic circulation to reach distant organs, such as the lungs and brain.\n\nSo, the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain is:\n\nSentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation\n\nThe correct answer is B) Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation.",
