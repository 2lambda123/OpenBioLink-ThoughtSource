cot: 'Reasoning:

  The patient is admitted to the labor and delivery suite with mild abdominal cramps,
  uterine contractions, and a watery vaginal discharge. She has a history of preterm
  birth. The vital signs are stable. The pelvic examination reveals cervical softening
  and shortening. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a cervical length of 12 mm, which
  is consistent with preterm labor. A tocolytic and a single dose of betamethasone
  are administered. Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that is given to pregnant women
  who are at risk of preterm delivery. It is given to accelerate fetal lung maturation
  and reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants. Betamethasone
  stimulates the production of surfactant by the fetal lungs. Surfactant is produced
  by type II pneumocytes in the fetal lungs. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Type
  II pneumocytes.
