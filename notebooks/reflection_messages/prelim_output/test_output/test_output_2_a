cot: 'Reasoning:

  The patient is a 3-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow discoloration
  of his skin. He had an upper respiratory tract infection one week ago. Examination
  shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. The spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below
  the left costal margin. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl and his mean corpuscular
  hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell. A Coombs test is negative. A peripheral
  blood smear is shown. The peripheral blood smear shows sickle cells. The patient
  has sickle cell anemia, which is a genetic disorder that causes abnormal hemoglobin
  to be produced. The abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become sickle-shaped,
  which can lead to blockages in small blood vessels. The patient is at greatest risk
  for complications related to sickle cell anemia.
