    Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that is administered to pregnant women at risk
    of preterm labor to help accelerate fetal lung maturation. The primary target
    of betamethasone in the fetal lung is the type II pneumocytes. These cells are
    responsible for producing and secreting surfactant, a substance that reduces surface
    tension in the alveoli and prevents lung collapse. By stimulating type II pneumocytes,
    betamethasone increases surfactant production, which improves lung function and
    reduces the risk of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants.
