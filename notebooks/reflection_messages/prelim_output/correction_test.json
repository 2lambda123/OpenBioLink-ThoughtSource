A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation.

Neutrophils are the first line of defense against bacterial infections and are recruited to the site of infection by chemotactic factors such as leukotriene B4 and interleukin-8. Platelet activating factor is also a potent chemotactic factor for neutrophils. Therefore, the most likely mediator responsible for the presence of neutrophils indicated by the arrow is leukotriene B4 or Platelet activating factor.\n\nfinal_answer: E) Leukotriene D4",
