He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"",

Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?",

His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care.

His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient\u2019s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg.

She takes hydrochlorothiazide and a daily vitamin. She has worked from home as a web graphic designer for 20 years. Questions about her social life reveal that she is very shy with few friends, and she often makes excuses to avoid parties and social gatherings. Despite this, she expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship.

Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient\u2019s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?",

He is noted to have multiple ecchymoses over his body, as well as petechiae and purpura. He has a laceration over his clavicle that continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage. Radiographs of his lower extremity show multiple long bone fractures. Two large bore IV lines are placed, and the patient oozes from around the sites of venepuncture. Labs are notable for a WBC of 20,000/mm^3, Hb of 10.1g/dL, platelets of 48,000/mm^3, and prolongation of the PT and aPTT.
