                "question": "A 77-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with the complaints of fever, malaise, and night sweats. She recently observed an enlargement of her axillary lymph nodes, which she examines on a weekly basis. She has a remote history of breast cancer in her 60s that was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. She also reports a history of extensive travel to Africa and a 30-pack-year history of smoking. On physical exam, several axillary lymph nodes are palpable with a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla measuring 10 x 8 cm. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates what the pathologist describes as \"a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL)\u2013diffuse large B cell variant\". Which of the following risk factors is responsible for this patient\u2019s condition?",

He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?",

There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) wound at the left fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion are noted on the left.\nThe most appropriate next step in management is needle decompression.

He has no family history of prostate disease. Physical examination is negative for any suprapubic mass or tenderness, and there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?\n\nTo answer this question, we should determine which conditions are most likely to present with the patient's symptoms. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a likely cause of frequency and decreased urine volume. Urinalysis and serum creatinine would be the next step in the evaluation of a UTI. An ultrasound would be the next step in the evaluation of a kidney stone. Prostate cancer is a less likely cause of the patient's symptoms. A digital rectal examination would be the next step in the evaluation of prostate cancer. Prostate-specific antigen would be the next step in the evaluation of prostate cancer.",

The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?",

The patient reports that he noticed a decrease in his hearing approximately 10 years ago. His wife says that he watches television at an elevated volume and appears to have trouble understanding what is being said to him, especially when there is background noise. He states that he also experiences constant ear ringing and episodes of unsteadiness. On physical examination, the outer ears are normal and otoscopic findings are unremarkable. The patient is unable to repeat the sentence said to him on whisper testing. When a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, it is heard equally on both ears. When the vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following structures is most likely impaired in this patient?",

GERD is most common in infants less than 1 year of age, with peak incidence at 2-4 months of age. It is most commonly seen in formula-fed infants, but is also seen in breastfed infants. It is characterized by regurgitation of stomach contents into the mouth or nose. It is usually worse in the supine position, and may be worse after eating. It is usually a mild problem, and does not require treatment. However, if the infant is having difficulty gaining weight, or if the reflux is severe, medical treatment may be necessary.\n\nThe most common treatment for GERD is a change in feeding position. This may involve holding the infant in a more upright position during feeds, or placing the infant in a bassinet with the head of the bed raised. This may help to reduce the amount of reflux. If this does not help, then medical treatment may be necessary. This may involve the use of antacids or other medications to reduce stomach acid.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about GERD is that it is usually a mild problem that does not require treatment.

The patient\u2019s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient\u2019s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. He is unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and the mini-mental status exam is inconclusive. He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. His gait is hemiparetic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

                "question": "Please refer to the summary above to answer this question\nA medical student is examining the table in the abstract. She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"",

After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?",

She has also developed shallow erythematous ulcers inside of her mouth. There is no history of chills, rigors, or headaches. Her appetite has decreased. The girl has been HIV-positive since birth and is being treated with HAART. Her baseline viral load is <50/mL. On general examination, the girl appears ill. Diffuse inspiratory crackles are heard on chest auscultation with normal heart sounds. No lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly is noted on physical examination. A blood sample is drawn, which shows a CD4 count of 100/mm3 and a viral load of 25,050/mL. What is the most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy?",

The most likely reason for resistance to HAART is the development of resistant viral strains. The development of resistant viral strains is most commonly due to the acquisition of mutations in the viral genome. The viral genome is composed of three main genes, gag, env, and pol. The pol gene codes for the viral enzymes reverse transcriptase and protease. Reverse transcriptase is responsible for the conversion of viral RNA to DNA, and protease is responsible for the maturation of the viral proteins. Mutations in the pol gene can lead to the development of resistant viral strains.\nSo, the answer is D) pol gene mutation.",

His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient\u2019s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7\u00b0C (97.0\u00b0F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient\u2019s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient\u2019s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms?",

Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient\u2019s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?",

The serum protein ratio of 7.0 g/dL is also elevated, which could be due to hypoalbuminemia or liver cirrhosis.

However, the serum protein ratio is also elevated, which is not typically seen in congestive heart failure.\n\nFor liver cirrhosis, the pleural fluid would typically have a high protein level and an elevated serum protein ratio, which is consistent with the findings in this patient.

                "question": "A 22-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician in April for seasonal allergies. She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?",

He is rapidly intubated, and vitals are a temperature of 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/64 mmHg. He is noted to have multiple ecchymoses over his body, as well as petechiae and purpura. He has a laceration over his clavicle that continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage. Radiographs of his lower extremity show multiple long bone fractures. Two large bore IV lines are placed, and the patient oozes from around the sites of venepuncture. Labs are notable for a WBC of 20,000/mm^3, Hb of 10.1g/dL, platelets of 48,000/mm^3, and prolongation of the PT and aPTT.

Pernicious anemia is caused by an autoimmune response against the gastric parietal cells, which results in a lack of intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  malabsorption, such as in inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  excessive intake of alcohol, which can lead to  malabsorption and  deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  vegan or vegetarian diets, which lack sources of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain medications, such as  metformin, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain medical conditions, such as  Crohn's disease, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain environmental factors, such as  exposure to lead or  other toxic metals, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain lifestyle factors, such as  smoking, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain genetic factors, such as  mutations in the  MTHFR gene, which can cause  malabsorption.

On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
