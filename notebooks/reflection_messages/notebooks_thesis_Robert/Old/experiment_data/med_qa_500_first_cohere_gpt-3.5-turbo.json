She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from \u201crandom\u201d bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, \u201cYes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.\u201d She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base.

Her height and weight are appropriate for her age, and she is up to date on all her vaccinations and has no medical complaints. She is doing well in school and has a part-time job stocking shelves at a clothing store. She was offered a higher-paying job as a cashier at the store, but she declined. She is very shy and withdrawn with the physician. Afterwards, her mother asks to speak to the physician alone and expresses concern that her daughter is very socially isolated and feels lonely. She is also worried that her daughter is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family. The daughter is interested in art and music, but hasn\u2019t participated in any extracurriculars because she says that she is untalented and thinks nobody wants to hang out with her. When her mother has encouraged her to invite friends over, the daughter bursts into tears and says, \u201cNobody wants to be friends with me, I am too lame and ugly and I just know I\u2019ll end up getting rejected.\u201d Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the daughter\u2019s behavior?",

                "question": "Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?",

The most common treatment for allergic conjunctivitis is a combination of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, such as ketotifen.\n\nSo, the most appropriate treatment for this patient would be ketotifen eye drops.",

Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study?",

He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination.

It is caused by antibodies to acetylcholine receptors, which prevent the muscle from receiving nerve signals. This results in muscle weakness that improves with rest. The most common symptoms are weakness of the eye muscles and drooping of the eyelids, known as ptosis. In some cases, the weakness can be severe and progress to the point of respiratory failure.\n\nThe most likely cause of the symptoms in this case is myasthenia gravis.",

His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor.

He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?",

She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?",

If left untreated, Lyme disease can spread to other areas and cause severe damage to the heart, brain, and joints.\n\nThe most common treatment for Lyme disease is antibiotics.

His adult children were concerned for his well being and called the police requesting a welfare check. He was found unresponsive in his gurague. There were several empty bottles of vodka around him and one half empty container of antifreeze. A review of his medical records reveals that he was previously in good health. Upon arrival to the ED he regains consciousness.  His blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg, heart rate 120/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F). On physical exam his speech is slurred and he has difficulty following commands. His abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation with no rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory tests show an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL.

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a likely cause of frequency and decreased urine volume. Urinalysis and serum creatinine would be the next step in the evaluation of a UTI. An ultrasound would be the next step in the evaluation of a kidney stone. Prostate cancer is a less likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

She vaguely explains that the necklace is to mask her scent from the moles tracking her. She has no past psychiatric history and she denies hearing voices or seeing objects.

The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?",

His wife says that he watches television at an elevated volume and appears to have trouble understanding what is being said to him, especially when there is background noise. He states that he also experiences constant ear ringing and episodes of unsteadiness. On physical examination, the outer ears are normal and otoscopic findings are unremarkable. The patient is unable to repeat the sentence said to him on whisper testing. When a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, it is heard equally on both ears. When the vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction.

She takes hydroxyurea, uses oxycodone as needed for pain, and an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. The patient\u2019s temperature is 97\u00b0F (36.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 145/72 mmHg, pulse is 93/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On physical examination, a left-sided facial droop is appreciated. She has trouble articulating her words, and her speech is garbled. She is put on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. Labs are obtained and pending. Which of the following therapies is most likely indicated?",

GERD is most common in infants less than 1 year of age, with peak incidence at 2-4 months of age. It is most commonly seen in formula-fed infants, but is also seen in breastfed infants. It is characterized by regurgitation of stomach contents into the mouth or nose. It is usually worse in the supine position, and may be worse after eating. It is usually a mild problem, and does not require treatment. However, if the infant is having difficulty gaining weight, or if the reflux is severe, medical treatment may be necessary.\n\nThe most common treatment for GERD is a change in feeding position. This may involve holding the infant in a more upright position during feeds, or placing the infant in a bassinet with the head of the bed raised. This may help to reduce the amount of reflux. If this does not help, then medical treatment may be necessary. This may involve the use of antacids or other medications to reduce stomach acid.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about GERD is that it is usually a mild problem that does not require treatment. In most cases, a change",

Two days ago she experienced extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated with brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. The patient has no relevant past medical history, however, the patient admits to being sexually abused by her boyfriend for the past year. Her current medications include ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. On physical exam it is noted that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward.

The patient\u2019s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient\u2019s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. He is unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and the mini-mental status exam is inconclusive. He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. His gait is hemiparetic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"",

Therefore, the correct answer is B) Posterior limb of the internal capsule.\n\nobj_1: 75\nobj_2: 90\nobj_3: 80\nobj_4: 70\nobj_5: 70\nobj_6: 70\nobj_7: 60\nobj_8: 70\nobj_9: 60\nobj_10: 80\nobj_11: 70",

His wife has noticed that he has been speaking more slowly than usual and his appetite has decreased. He used to enjoy dance classes with her but has not been as interested in this recently. He is a veteran who returned from a deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?",

The most likely reason for resistance to HAART is the development of resistant viral strains. The development of resistant viral strains is most commonly due to the acquisition of mutations in the viral genome. The viral genome is composed of three main genes, gag, env, and pol. The pol gene codes for the viral enzymes reverse transcriptase and protease. Reverse transcriptase is responsible for the conversion of viral RNA to DNA, and protease is responsible for the maturation of the viral proteins. Mutations in the pol gene can lead to the development of resistant viral strains.\nSo, the answer is D) pol gene mutation.",

Her last period occurred 4 months ago but she has not had sex in the last year and home pregnancy tests have come back negative. She first started having periods at age 13 and her periods have been unremarkable up until they stopped 4 months ago. Her past medical history is significant for radius and ulnar forearm fractures that she sustained in a car crash 3 months ago. She didn't see the car coming and has had increasing difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision. She also notes having recurrent headaches 5 months ago. Otherwise she has been healthy with no previous pregnancies. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea and temporal field visual defects. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's amenorrhea?",

He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient\u2019s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7\u00b0C (97.0\u00b0F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient\u2019s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient\u2019s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms?",

He has no history of serious illness or trauma. His father has a history of pulmonary embolism. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily since he started college 3 years ago. He appears very distressed. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient is administered a 5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion. Six hours later, the activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

Initially, the swelling was minimal, but now she is finding it difficult to walk and she can\u2019t fit into any of her shoes. Her medical history is significant for systemic lupus erythematosus. She takes ibuprofen and hydroxychloroquine. Her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 153/86 mmHg, and pulse is 88 beats/min. Pitting edema to bilateral knees is noted on physical examination. Urinalysis reveals proteinuria. The patient is started on an immunosuppressant. Two days later the patient returns to clinic complaining of blood in her urine. A urinalysis reveals moderate erythrocytes but is negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, or crystals. Diffuse oozing of the bladder mucosa with neovascularization is seen on cystoscopy. Which of the following could have prevented the patient\u2019s condition?",

Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient\u2019s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?",

While it correctly identifies rigor mortis as the cause of the observed stiffness, it incorrectly attributes it to the precipitation of calcium phosphate salts. The correct explanation is that after death, the body's muscles are unable to relax due to the depletion of ATP, which is required for muscle relaxation. This leads to the cross-bridges between actin and myosin filaments to remain bound, causing the muscles to remain contracted and become stiff. The cooling of the body after death does contribute to the onset and progression of rigor mortis, but it is not the primary cause.\n\nobj_1: 50\nobj_2: 100\nobj_3: 50\nobj_4: 50\nobj_5: 50\nobj_6: 50\nobj_7: 50\nobj_8: 50\nobj_9: 0\nobj_10: 50\nobj_11: 100",

TLS can lead to acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications.

The pleural fluid has a high protein level of 5.8 g/dL, which could be consistent with a few different conditions, such as congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or lymphoma. The serum protein ratio of 7.0 g/dL is also elevated, which could be due to hypoalbuminemia or liver cirrhosis. The LDH level of 258 U/L is also elevated, which could be due to congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, or lymphoma.\n\nNow that we have narrowed down the possible conditions that could have led to the findings in the patient's pleural fluid, let's look at the specific conditions and see if we can further narrow down the answer.\n\nFor congestive heart failure, the pleural fluid would typically have a high protein level and an elevated LDH level, which is consistent with the findings in this patient. However, the serum protein ratio is also elevated, which is not typically seen in congestive heart failure.\n\nFor liver cirrhosis, the pleural fluid would typically have a high protein level and an elevated serum protein ratio, which is consistent with the findings in this patient. However, the LDH level is also elevated, which is not typically seen in liver cirrhosis.\n\nFor lymphoma, the pleural fluid would typically have a high protein level and an elevated LDH level, which is consistent with the findings in this patient. However, the serum protein ratio is also elevated, which is not typically seen in lymphoma.\n\nFor nephrotic syndrome, the pleural fluid would typically have a low protein level and a low serum protein ratio, which is not consistent with the findings in this patient.\n\nBased on the findings in the patient's pleural fluid and the specific conditions that could have led to those findings, the most likely answer is congestive heart failure.",

She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?",

She also reports mild constipation and joint pain. Approximately 6-months ago, she experienced palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor. Her past medical history is significant for asthma. Her father is not living and had Parkinson disease, and her mother has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. She is currently sexually active in a monogamous relationship and uses contraception consistently. She denies cigarette smoking and occasionally drinks wine. She experimented once with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago. Her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 127/98 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, the patient has slow speech and movement. She has tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints. She has delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can present with paresthesias, especially in the lower limbs. The most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency is  pernicious anemia. Pernicious anemia is caused by an autoimmune response against the gastric parietal cells, which results in a lack of intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  malabsorption, such as in inflammatory bowel disease. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  excessive intake of alcohol, which can lead to  malabsorption and  deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  vegan or vegetarian diets, which lack sources of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain medications, such as  metformin, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain medical conditions, such as  Crohn's disease, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain environmental factors, such as  exposure to lead or  other toxic metals, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain lifestyle factors, such as  smoking, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain genetic factors, such as  mutations in the  MTHFR gene, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain iatrogenic factors, such as  surgery or  other procedures, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain infectious agents, such as  viruses, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain toxic agents, such as  heavy metals, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain nutritional deficiencies, such as  deficiencies in  folic acid or  other B vitamins, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain diseases, such as  pernicious anemia, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be caused by  certain conditions, such as  pregnancy, which can cause  malabsorption. Vitamin B",

On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?",

Therefore, the reasoning should have considered other possible diagnoses and causes of the patient's symptoms before arriving at a conclusion. \n\nobj_1: 50\nobj_2: 50\nobj_3: 75\nobj_4: 50\nobj_5: 50\nobj_6: 50\nobj_7: 50\nobj_8: 50\nobj_9: 50\nobj_10: 50\nobj_11: 75",
