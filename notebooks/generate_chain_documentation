The data loader contains the following functions:

generate_extract_flexibly
generate_flexible
extract_flexible
metareason_flexible

These functions call methods in the generate_chain.py file, namely:
- self_generate_extract
- self_generate
- self_extract
- self_reflect

All of them require an input_dictionary with variables and a langchain.
However, the different functions are there to put the right output in the right ts-variables of the schema.

flexible_langchains.ipynb is a tutorial
And experiments are performed in langchain_experiments.ipynb (internal)

Issues:
*Only works if a split is defined
*How to choose which existing CoT to use in self_reflect for instance?
