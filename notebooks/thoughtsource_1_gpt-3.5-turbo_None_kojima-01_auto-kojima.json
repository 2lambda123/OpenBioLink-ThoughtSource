Gravity is directly proportional to the mass of an object, so the more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull. Earth's mass is what causes objects to be attracted towards it.\n\nB) The rotation of Earth: This is not correct. The rotation of Earth causes the Coriolis effect, which affects the movement of air and water, but it does not directly affect gravity.\n\nC) The revolution of Earth: This is not correct. The revolution of Earth around the sun affects the seasons and the length of the day, but it does not directly affect gravity.\n\nD) Weather patterns on Earth: This is not correct. Weather patterns are caused by atmospheric conditions and do not directly affect gravity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) the mass of Earth.",
