She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.7 g/dL\nLeukocytes 11,200/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h\nSerum\nCreatine kinase 212 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L\nAST 34 U/L\nALT 35 U/L\nWhich of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\"",

Most of the cases follow trauma.it can be accidental or surgical. Inflammation, mucoceles of sinuses, sinunasal polyposis, fungal infection of sinuses & osteomyelitis, can all erode the bone and dura. Neoplasms, idiopathic- where cause is unknown and patient has spontaneous leak. SITE OF Leakage- CSF from anterior cranial fossa reaches the nose (1) cribriform plate, (2) roof of ethmoid air cells or (3) frontal sinus. CSF from middle cranial fossa follows injuries to sphenoid sinus, cribriform plate. In fracture of temporal bone, CSF reaches the middle ear and then escapes through the Eustachian tube into the nose (CSF OTORHINORRHOEA) DIAGNOSIS- there is history of clear watery discharge from the nose on bending the head or straining. CSF rhinorrhea should be differentiated from nasal discharge as the former is sudden, gushes in drops when bending and cannot be sniffed back. CSF rhinorrhea after head trauma is mixed with blood and shows \"target sign\" when collected on filter paper.it shows central red spot and peripheral lighter halo sign. LAB TEST = BETA-2 transferrin is seen in CSF and not in the nasal discharge. its presence is a specific and sensitive test."
