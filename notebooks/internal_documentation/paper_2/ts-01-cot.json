Residual volume is the amount of air that remains in the lungs after a maximal expiration, and it tends to increase with age due to decreased lung elasticity.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is E, decreased A-a gradient. The A-a gradient is the difference in oxygen tension between the alveoli and the arterial blood, and it tends to increase with age due to decreased lung function.

This rules out Gilbert syndrome, which is a benign condition characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. \n\nRotor syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but it is usually associated with elevated levels of other liver enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). \n\nGlucuronyl transferase deficiency is another name for Crigler-Najjar syndrome, which is a rare inherited disorder that causes severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. This is not consistent with the patient's presentation. \n\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease that causes damage to the bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and elevated levels of both direct and indirect bilirubin. However, other liver enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase and GGT are also elevated in this condition. \n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Rotor syndrome.",
