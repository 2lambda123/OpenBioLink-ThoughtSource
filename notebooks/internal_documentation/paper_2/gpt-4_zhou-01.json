Liver function tests (LFTs) are usually normal.\n\nB) Gilbert syndrome: A common, mild liver disorder in which the liver does not properly process bilirubin, leading to slightly elevated levels of indirect bilirubin. LFTs are usually normal.\n\nC) Glucuronyl transferase deficiency: Also known as Crigler-Najjar syndrome, it is a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe jaundice due to high levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. LFTs are usually normal.\n\nD) Primary biliary cirrhosis: A chronic liver disease characterized by the destruction of bile ducts, leading to the accumulation of bile in the liver and elevated levels of direct bilirubin. LFTs are usually abnormal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given case: A patient with jaundice and 50% direct bilirubin, with normal LFTs. This suggests that the issue is related to the processing of bilirubin, rather than liver damage or dysfunction. \n\nConsidering the options, Rotor syndrome (A) seems to be the most likely diagnosis, as it is characterized by elevated levels of both direct and indirect bilirubin with normal LFTs. Gilbert syndrome (B) and Glucuronyl transferase deficiency (C) are less likely, as they primarily involve elevated indirect bilirubin. Primary biliary cirrhosis (D) is also less likely, as LFTs are usually abnormal in this condition.\n\nSo, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nA) Rotor syndrome",

D: CoisoneFetal adrenals shows hyperophy of the reticular zone (fetal zone), which is the site of synthesis of oestriol precursor, coisol and dehydroepiandrosterone.After 12 weeks of gestation, the activity of 3 p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B) decreases in fetal adrenal and sulfokinase activity increases.At that time (during the mid-gestation, 12 to 22 weeks) the major steroid products are DHEA and DHEA Sulfate (DHEA-S).During the mid-gestation (12 to 22 weeks), the aromatase activity and sulfokinase activity increases. So Placenta itself utilizes fetal DHEA and DHEA-S as substrate for estrone and estradiol as precursors."
