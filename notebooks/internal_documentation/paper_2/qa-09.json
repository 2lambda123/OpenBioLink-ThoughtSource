The patient has abdominal pain and constipation for 3 weeks, increasing irritability, pale conjunctivae, abdominal tenderness, and developmental delays in language and cognitive skills.\n2. The presence of small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling suggests a defect in heme synthesis, which is involved in the production of hemoglobin and other heme-containing proteins. Heme synthesis involves several steps, including the conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen, the conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane, and the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III.\n3. Based on the biochemical pathways involved, the most likely process impaired in this patient is the conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen (option C). This is because the symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a defect in heme synthesis, and the conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen is the first and rate-limiting step in heme synthesis. Defects in this step can lead to a buildup of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, which can cause neurological symptoms and abdominal pain. Options A, B, D, and E are not directly involved in heme synthesis and are therefore less likely to be impaired in this patient.",

Recall the causes of jaundice with elevated direct bilirubin: hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, or a combination of both.\n3. Consider the differential diagnosis for cholestatic jaundice with normal liver enzymes: Rotor syndrome, Gilbert syndrome, and glucuronyl transferase deficiency.\n4. Evaluate each potential diagnosis based on the information provided in the case.\n\nGoing through each step:\n1. The key information in the case is that the patient has 50% direct bilirubin and normal liver function tests (LFTs).\n2. Jaundice with elevated direct bilirubin can be caused by hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, or a combination of both. Since the LFTs are normal, hepatocellular injury is less likely.\n3. The differential diagnosis for cholestatic jaundice with normal LFTs includes Rotor syndrome, Gilbert syndrome, and glucuronyl transferase deficiency.\n4. Rotor syndrome is characterized by elevated levels of both direct and indirect bilirubin, as well as elevated liver enzymes. Since the liver enzymes are normal in this case, Rotor syndrome is unlikely. Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition that causes mild jaundice and elevated indirect bilirubin, but direct bilirubin levels are typically normal. Glucuronyl transferase deficiency (also known as Crigler-Najjar syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder that causes severe jaundice and elevated direct bilirubin levels. Given the information provided in the case, glucuronyl transferase deficiency is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) Glucuronyl transferase deficiency.",

Therefore, her history with gorillas is not relevant to this question.\n2. Gorillas are generally peaceful and non-aggressive towards humans, but they can become aggressive if they feel threatened or if their territory is invaded.\n3. Without any specific reason for Charla Nash to be anxious near gorillas, it is not expected that she would be anxious near them.\n\nAnswer: B) False",
