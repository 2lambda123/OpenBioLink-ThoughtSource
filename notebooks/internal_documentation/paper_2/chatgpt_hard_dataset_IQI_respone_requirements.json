Spider bites can cause severe systemic symptoms, including fever, chills, muscle pain, and weakness, and can be life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals. Cat, human, dog, and fish bites are less likely to cause such severe symptoms and complications.\n\nStep 4: Provide supporting evidence or references.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), spider bites can cause a range of symptoms, from mild irritation to severe systemic reactions, and can be particularly dangerous in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with sickle cell disease (CDC, 2021). In contrast, cat, human, dog, and fish bites are more likely to cause local inflammation and infection, but are generally less severe and less likely to cause systemic symptoms (CDC, 202",
