He was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. He has mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. His temperature is elevated, and his blood pressure is slightly elevated.\\n\\nStep 3: Analyze the laboratory results\\nThe patient's leukocyte count is elevated, with a high percentage of segmented neutrophils and eosinophils. His erythrocyte sedimentation rate is also elevated. His serum creatinine is significantly elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.\\n\\nStep 4: Consider the renal biopsy findings\\nThe renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles.\\n\\nStep 5: Determine the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms\\nThe combination of decreased urinary output, malaise, elevated temperature, elevated blood pressure, skin discoloration, elevated leukocyte count with eosinophilia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and kidney dysfunction with intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles on biopsy is most consistent with cholesterol embolization syndrome. This is a complication of cardiac catheterization and stenting, particularly in patients with pre-existing atherosclerosis and other risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The cholesterol emboli can cause systemic inflammation, kidney dysfunction, and skin discoloration. The eosinophilia may be a nonspecific finding in this context. Renal papillary necrosis, allergic interstitial nephritis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and polyarteritis nodosa are less likely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms based on the available information.\",\n",

This is a complication of cardiac catheterization and stenting, which can cause cholesterol crystals to break off from atherosclerotic plaques and travel to other parts of the body, including the kidneys. This can lead to renal dysfunction, decreased urinary output, and other symptoms. The mottled, purplish discoloration of the feet is also consistent with cholesterol embolization. Allergic interstitial nephritis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis are less likely causes, as the patient's eosinophil count is not significantly elevated.

A creatinine level of 4.2 is very high, and is indicative of renal failure. This, combined with the finding of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles on renal biopsy, points to the diagnosis of cholesterol embolization.\\n\\nCholesterol embolization is a condition in which cholesterol particles become lodged in small arteries, causing them to become blocked. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including renal failure, malaise, and purplish discoloration of the skin (as seen in this patient). Treatment is typically supportive, and may involve dialysis and/or blood transfusion.\",\n",
