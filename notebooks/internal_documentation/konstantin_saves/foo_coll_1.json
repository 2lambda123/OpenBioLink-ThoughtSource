The benefits of defining coronary anatomy have to be weighed against the risks of additional delay before surgical intervention.\nRetrospective analysis of patient charts and the Cardiovascular Information Registry (CVIR) at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.\nWe studied 122 patients who underwent emergency surgery of the aorta between January 1982 and December 1997. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 18.0%, and there was no significant difference between those who had coronary angiography on the day of surgery compared with those who had not (No: 16%, n = 81 vs. Yes: 22%, n = 41, p = 0.46). Multivariate analysis revealed that a history of myocardial infarction (MI) was the only predictor of in-hospital mortality (relative risk: 4.98 95% confidence interval: 1.48-16.75, p = 0.009); however, coronary angiography had no impact on in-hospital mortality in patients with a history of MI. Furthermore, coronary angiography did not significantly affect the incidence of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during aortic surgery (17% vs. 25%, Yes vs. No). Operative reports revealed that 74% of all CABG procedures were performed because of coronary dissection, and not coronary artery disease.",

Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength as well as position sense were measured using the Biodex system. Timed up and go test, stair climbing test, and the 6-min walk test were used to assess physical performance. The results of each group were also compared with those from the corresponding healthy control, respectively.\nDemography showed significant difference in the mean age between bicompartment (54.8 \u00b1 5.6 years) and TKA groups (65.7 \u00b1 6.7 years). Comparing between the two groups, knee extensor and flexor torque, hamstring/Quadriceps ratio, position sense, and physical performance were not significantly different preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after surgery. In intra-group analysis, muscle strength and position sense at each time point were not different in both groups.
