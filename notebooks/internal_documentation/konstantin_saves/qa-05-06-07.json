The information provided in the case suggests that the patient has no abnormalities and her vital signs are within normal limits. To answer the question, we need to understand the normal changes in respiratory function that occur with aging. \n\nA) Increased lung compliance: This is unlikely as lung compliance decreases with age due to changes in the elasticity of lung tissue. \n\nB) Increased vital capacity: This is also unlikely as vital capacity decreases with age due to changes in lung tissue and chest wall compliance. \n\nC) Decreased residual volume: This is possible as residual volume decreases with age due to changes in lung tissue and chest wall compliance. \n\nD) Increased chest wall compliance: This is unlikely as chest wall compliance decreases with age due to changes in the elasticity of chest wall tissue. \n\nE) Decreased A-a gradient: This is unlikely to be related to age and is not a direct measure of respiratory function. \n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is C) Decreased residual volume.",
