Most of the cases follow trauma.it can be accidental or surgical. Inflammation, mucoceles of sinuses, sinunasal polyposis, fungal infection of sinuses & osteomyelitis, can all erode the bone and dura. Neoplasms, idiopathic- where cause is unknown and patient has spontaneous leak. SITE OF Leakage- CSF from anterior cranial fossa reaches the nose (1) cribriform plate, (2) roof of ethmoid air cells or (3) frontal sinus. CSF from middle cranial fossa follows injuries to sphenoid sinus, cribriform plate. In fracture of temporal bone, CSF reaches the middle ear and then escapes through the Eustachian tube into the nose (CSF OTORHINORRHOEA) DIAGNOSIS- there is history of clear watery discharge from the nose on bending the head or straining. CSF rhinorrhea should be differentiated from nasal discharge as the former is sudden, gushes in drops when bending and cannot be sniffed back. CSF rhinorrhea after head trauma is mixed with blood and shows \"target sign\" when collected on filter paper.it shows central red spot and peripheral lighter halo sign. LAB TEST = BETA-2 transferrin is seen in CSF and not in the nasal discharge. its presence is a specific and sensitive test."

It works by blocking the action of certain natural chemicals in your body, such as epinephrine, on the heart and blood vessels. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker, which is used to treat high blood pressure and certain types of chest pain. It works by relaxing the muscles of your heart and blood vessels.\n\nThe combination of Metoprolol and Verapamil can result in bradycardia with AV block, which is a slowing of the heart rate and a disruption of the normal electrical conduction of the heart. This can lead to a decrease in blood pressure and an increased risk of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation and torsades de pointes. Tachycardia is not a likely result of this combination. \n\nAnswer: B) Bradycardia with AV Block",

Most intraoral machines use 60 to 70 kVp. The availability of constant-potential (fully rectified), high-frequency or direct current (DC)\u00a0dental X-ray units have made possible the production of radiographs with lower kilovoltage and at reduced levels of radiation. The surface exposure required to produce a comparable radiographic density using a constant-potential unit is approximately 25% less than that of a conventional self-rectified unit operating at the same kilovoltage. At the present time, several manufacturers produce DC units.\nThus, in intraoral radiograph, patient radiation is not decreased by decreasing kVp.\n\u00a0Reference: White and Pharoah's Oral Radiology Principles and Interpretation 7th edition page no 36"

It is used to reduce the amount of time the patient needs to be exposed to radiation.\n\nB) Intensifying screens - Intensifying screens do reduce patient radiation. They are placed between the radiation source and the film, and they absorb some of the radiation before it reaches the film.\n\nC) Lead apron - Lead aprons also reduce patient radiation. They are worn by the patient and absorb some of the radiation before it reaches the patient.\n\nD) Decreasing kVp - Decreasing kVp does reduce patient radiation. kVp stands for kilovolt peak, and it is a measure of the amount of radiation being used. Lowering the kVp will reduce the amount of radiation the patient is exposed to.\n\nThe correct answer is A) High speed film.",

D: CoisoneFetal adrenals shows hyperophy of the reticular zone (fetal zone), which is the site of synthesis of oestriol precursor, coisol and dehydroepiandrosterone.After 12 weeks of gestation, the activity of 3 p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B) decreases in fetal adrenal and sulfokinase activity increases.At that time (during the mid-gestation, 12 to 22 weeks) the major steroid products are DHEA and DHEA Sulfate (DHEA-S).During the mid-gestation (12 to 22 weeks), the aromatase activity and sulfokinase activity increases. So Placenta itself utilizes fetal DHEA and DHEA-S as substrate for estrone and estradiol as precursors."
