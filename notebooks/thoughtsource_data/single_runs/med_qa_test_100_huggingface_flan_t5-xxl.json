Vitals show a temperature of 37-0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, pulse of 115/min, respirations of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic and unresponsive. Extremities are pale and cool. There is a 3-inch long penetrating wound between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side of the chest, which is bleeding profusely. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is intubated and aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, including a blood transfusion. Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?",

                "question": "A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.7 g/dL\nLeukocytes 11,200/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h\nSerum\nCreatine kinase 212 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L\nAST 34 U/L\nALT 35 U/L\nWhich of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\"",

On examination, a thyroid nodule was present; the nodule was fixed, immobile, and non-tender. Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule with a size of 2 cm. Histological examination of a fine needle biopsy was performed and cytological examination reported a likely suspicion of neoplasia. CT scan is performed to check for any lesions in the bones and/or lungs, common metastatic sites in this condition. Treatment with radioiodine therapy is planned after near-total thyroidectomy. Considering this tumor, which of the following is the most likely initial metastatic site in this patient?",

He has had one small bowel movement in 4 days. Normally he has a bowel movement once a day. His medical history is notable for poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and atorvastatin. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and drinks 3-4 beers per day. His diet consists primarily of fast food. His temperature is 101.8\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. A review of the patient\u2019s medical record reveals colonoscopy results from 1 year ago. Relevant findings included multiple small, pedunculated polyps which were removed, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses. This patient\u2019s condition is most strongly associated with which of the following disorders?",

He was diagnosed with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. At the present time, he is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. A sputum sample is sent for culture and the patient is started on vancomycin.The pediatrician tells the patient\u2019s family that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree which increases the patient's chances of future infections. He will have to undergo chest physiotherapy and they should report any signs of infection immediately to a medical professional. Which of the following pathogens will most likely infect this patient in adulthood?",

He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",

He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have \u2018high blood sugars\u2019 when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive.

She states that she feels as though her \u201clungs are falling apart,\u201d noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from \u201crandom\u201d bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, \u201cYes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.\u201d She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being \u201cglove-finger shadows\u201d (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated.

Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual.

She is doing well in school and has a part-time job stocking shelves at a clothing store. She was offered a higher-paying job as a cashier at the store, but she declined. She is very shy and withdrawn with the physician. Afterwards, her mother asks to speak to the physician alone and expresses concern that her daughter is very socially isolated and feels lonely. She is also worried that her daughter is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family. The daughter is interested in art and music, but hasn\u2019t participated in any extracurriculars because she says that she is untalented and thinks nobody wants to hang out with her. When her mother has encouraged her to invite friends over, the daughter bursts into tears and says, \u201cNobody wants to be friends with me, I am too lame and ugly and I just know I\u2019ll end up getting rejected.\u201d Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the daughter\u2019s behavior?",

                "question": "Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?",

She mentions that she has tried over-the-counter lubricants, but lubricants do not seem to provide substantial relief. Her medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. She has been sexually active with her husband until recently and reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse. The physical examination reveals dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted. The perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
