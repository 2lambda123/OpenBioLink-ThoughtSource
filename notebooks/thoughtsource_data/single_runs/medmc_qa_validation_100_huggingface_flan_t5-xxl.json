Serotonin can elicit Bezold-Jarisch reflex.Bezold-Jarisch reflex responds to noxious ventricular stimuli sensed by chemoreceptors & mechanoreceptors within the LV wall by inducing the triad of hypotension bradycardia & coronary aery dilatation.Stimulation of aerial baroreceptors or ventricular baroreceptors by any of a host of chemicals-veratrum alkaloids, nicotine capsaicin, anti-histamine serotonin snake and insect venoms--can also trigger the Bezold- Jarisch reflex."

Most of the cases follow trauma.it can be accidental or surgical. Inflammation, mucoceles of sinuses, sinunasal polyposis, fungal infection of sinuses & osteomyelitis, can all erode the bone and dura. Neoplasms, idiopathic- where cause is unknown and patient has spontaneous leak. SITE OF Leakage- CSF from anterior cranial fossa reaches the nose (1) cribriform plate, (2) roof of ethmoid air cells or (3) frontal sinus. CSF from middle cranial fossa follows injuries to sphenoid sinus, cribriform plate. In fracture of temporal bone, CSF reaches the middle ear and then escapes through the Eustachian tube into the nose (CSF OTORHINORRHOEA) DIAGNOSIS- there is history of clear watery discharge from the nose on bending the head or straining. CSF rhinorrhea should be differentiated from nasal discharge as the former is sudden, gushes in drops when bending and cannot be sniffed back. CSF rhinorrhea after head trauma is mixed with blood and shows \"target sign\" when collected on filter paper.it shows central red spot and peripheral lighter halo sign. LAB TEST = BETA-2 transferrin is seen in CSF and not in the nasal discharge. its presence is a specific and sensitive test."

                    "Kilovoltage:\nThe optimal operating potential of dental X-ray units is between 60 and 70 kVp (ADA 2012).\nAlthough image diagnosis may be improved slightly with increased image contrast (low kVp) images, the patient dose is reduced with higher kVp exposures. Most intraoral machines use 60 to 70 kVp. The availability of constant-potential (fully rectified), high-frequency or direct current (DC)\u00a0dental X-ray units have made possible the production of radiographs with lower kilovoltage and at reduced levels of radiation. The surface exposure required to produce a comparable radiographic density using a constant-potential unit is approximately 25% less than that of a conventional self-rectified unit operating at the same kilovoltage. At the present time, several manufacturers produce DC units.\nThus, in intraoral radiograph, patient radiation is not decreased by decreasing kVp.\n\u00a0Reference: White and Pharoah's Oral Radiology Principles and Interpretation 7th edition page no 36"

D: CoisoneFetal adrenals shows hyperophy of the reticular zone (fetal zone), which is the site of synthesis of oestriol precursor, coisol and dehydroepiandrosterone.After 12 weeks of gestation, the activity of 3 p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B) decreases in fetal adrenal and sulfokinase activity increases.At that time (during the mid-gestation, 12 to 22 weeks) the major steroid products are DHEA and DHEA Sulfate (DHEA-S).During the mid-gestation (12 to 22 weeks), the aromatase activity and sulfokinase activity increases. So Placenta itself utilizes fetal DHEA and DHEA-S as substrate for estrone and estradiol as precursors."
