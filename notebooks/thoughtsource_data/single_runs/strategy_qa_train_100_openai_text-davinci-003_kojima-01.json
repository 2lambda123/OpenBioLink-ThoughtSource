The Invisible Man is a science fiction horror film released in 1933, while Picnic at Hanging Rock is a mystery drama released in 1975.\n\nSecond, let's consider how prevalent each of these films are in films. The Invisible Man has been remade several times, and is a classic horror film that is still widely known today. Picnic at Hanging Rock, on the other hand, is not as widely known and has not been remade.\n\nBased on this information, it is safe to say that The Invisible Man is more prevalent in films than Picnic at Hanging Rock.",
