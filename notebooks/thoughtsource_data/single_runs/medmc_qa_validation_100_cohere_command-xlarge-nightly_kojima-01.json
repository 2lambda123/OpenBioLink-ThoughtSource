Most of the cases follow trauma.it can be accidental or surgical. Inflammation, mucoceles of sinuses, sinunasal polyposis, fungal infection of sinuses & osteomyelitis, can all erode the bone and dura. Neoplasms, idiopathic- where cause is unknown and patient has spontaneous leak. SITE OF Leakage- CSF from anterior cranial fossa reaches the nose (1) cribriform plate, (2) roof of ethmoid air cells or (3) frontal sinus. CSF from middle cranial fossa follows injuries to sphenoid sinus, cribriform plate. In fracture of temporal bone, CSF reaches the middle ear and then escapes through the Eustachian tube into the nose (CSF OTORHINORRHOEA) DIAGNOSIS- there is history of clear watery discharge from the nose on bending the head or straining. CSF rhinorrhea should be differentiated from nasal discharge as the former is sudden, gushes in drops when bending and cannot be sniffed back. CSF rhinorrhea after head trauma is mixed with blood and shows \"target sign\" when collected on filter paper.it shows central red spot and peripheral lighter halo sign. LAB TEST = BETA-2 transferrin is seen in CSF and not in the nasal discharge. its presence is a specific and sensitive test."

                    "Side effect of high dose epidural opioid: Nausea and vomiting Pruritis Urinary retention Respiratory depression High dose of opioid can spread centrally and stimulate CTZ center and can precipitate nausea and vomiting. Pruritis due to morphine is not due to histamine release, high dose morphine can spread centrally, act on trigeminal nerve and cause pruritis. Urinary retention in morphine use is due to it's action on sacral spinal cord, therefore it can happen even at normal dose and not related to high dose. Respiratory depression in morphine overdose due to migration of morphine centrally."

Most intraoral machines use 60 to 70 kVp. The availability of constant-potential (fully rectified), high-frequency or direct current (DC)\u00a0dental X-ray units have made possible the production of radiographs with lower kilovoltage and at reduced levels of radiation. The surface exposure required to produce a comparable radiographic density using a constant-potential unit is approximately 25% less than that of a conventional self-rectified unit operating at the same kilovoltage. At the present time, several manufacturers produce DC units.\nThus, in intraoral radiograph, patient radiation is not decreased by decreasing kVp.\n\u00a0Reference: White and Pharoah's Oral Radiology Principles and Interpretation 7th edition page no 36"

The I0 has to get the child medically examined in a government hospital or local hospital within 24 hours of receiving information about the offence with consent of the child or parent or a competent person whom the child trusts and in their presence.Some child-friendly procedure envisaged:At night no child to be detained in the police station.The statement of the child to be recorded as spoken by the child.Frequent breaks for the child during trial.Child not to be called repeatedly to testify.PunishmentOffencePunishmentPenetrative sexual assault7 years imprisonmentAggravated penetrative sexual assault10 years imprisonmentSexual assault3-5 years imprisonmentAggravated sexual assault5-7 years imprisonmentSexual harassment3 years imprisonmentUsing a child for prolonged purposes3-5 years imprisonment.
