It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals . Together with the leading flagellum , the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light , often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis , and to predict day and night , the primary function of circadian rhythms . Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms , and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles .

Spike has a few weaknesses that Tom tries to capitalize upon : his possessiveness about his bone and his ticklishness . He made his first appearance in the 1942 Tom and Jerry cartoon Dog Trouble , and his first speaking role was in 1944 's The Bodyguard , where he was voiced by Billy Bletcher up until 1949 , from which point he was voiced by Daws Butler .

In Tom and Jerry Kids , Tyke does have a speaking role in the program and is the first time that viewers were able to hear Tyke speak . Spike is very protective towards his son and gets very angry at Tom if Tyke is bothered or harmed . Although Tyke has spoken in Tom and Jerry Kids , he has laughed in one Tom and Jerry short .

The need to limit body weight in order , for example , to fly , has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species , such as bats . Most of the brain 's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge ( membrane potential ) of neurons . Most vertebrate species devote between 2 % and 8 % of basal metabolism to the brain . In primates , however , the percentage is much higher -- in humans it rises to 20 -- 25 % . The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time , but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions ; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods PET , fMRI , and NIRS . The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen - dependent metabolism of glucose ( i.e. , blood sugar ) , but ketones provide a major alternative source , together with contributions from medium chain fatty acids ( caprylic and heptanoic acids ) , lactate , acetate , and possibly amino acids .",

Over the next two years , a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state . In 1912 , Massachusetts passed the first American minimum wage legislation , which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children . Within eight years , at least thirteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia would pass minimum wage laws , with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women 's voluntary associations and organized labor . The United States Supreme Court of the Lochner era consistently invalidated compulsory minimum wage laws . Advocates for these minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of Muller v. Oregon , which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not . However , the Court did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws , considering the latter as interfering with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees .",

Three weeks later , the 71 - bed Richmond Field Hospital opened . Six first aid stations were set up in the shipyards to treat industrial accidents and minor illness . Each first aid station had an ambulance ready to rush patients to the surgical field hospital if required . Stabilized patients could be moved to the larger hospital for recuperative care . The Northern Permanente Hospital opened two weeks later to serve workers at the Kaiser shipyard in Vancouver , Washington . Shipyard workers paid seven cents per day for comprehensive health care coverage ; and within a year the shipyard health plan employed sixty physicians with salaries between $450 and $1,000 per month . These physicians established California Physicians Service to offer similar health coverage to the families of shipyard workers .

            "paragraph": "Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at mid-ocean ridges , where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually moves away from the ridge . Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics . When oceanic plates diverge , tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure , although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges . At a spreading center basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed . Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers . Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone . Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast , intermediate , or slow . As a general rule , fast ridges see spreading rate of more than 9 cm / year . Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 4 -- 9 cm / year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 4 cm / year .",

An attempt by the Americans to board Serapis was repulsed , as was an attempt by the British to board Bonhomme Richard . Finally , after another of Jones 's ships joined the fight , the British captain was forced to surrender at about 10 : 30 p.m. The Bonhomme Richard -- shattered , on fire , leaking badly -- defied all efforts to save her and sank about 36 hours later at 11 : 00 a.m. on Saturday , 25 September 1779 .

The main forms of precipitation include drizzle , rain , sleet , snow , graupel and hail . Precipitation occurs when a portion of the atmosphere becomes saturated with water vapor , so that the water condenses and `` precipitates '' . Thus , fog and mist are not precipitation but suspensions , because the water vapor does not condense sufficiently to precipitate . Two processes , possibly acting together , can lead to air becoming saturated : cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air . Precipitation forms as smaller droplets coalesce via collision with other rain drops or ice crystals within a cloud . Short , intense periods of rain in scattered locations are called `` showers .

Zenger High as a freshman , along with his three best friends , Mitch , Patrick , and Kyle , and quickly realizes that it is very different from middle school . Upperclassmen are intimidating and will steal any lunch money along with loose change if you stand in the wrong place . Scott gets put in advanced classes , including an Honors English class which , despite the amount of homework , is his favorite class . His teacher , Mr. Franka , becomes a mentor to him . Scott finds out that he 's not in classes with his friends since he 's carrying all honors and college prep classes . He tries his best from the very start to get the attention of Julia Baskins , a girl who was in his kindergarten class and has recently become very beautiful over the summer . Because of her beauty she quickly blends in with the popular girls and is attracted to the football players who are often bullying Scott . Scott is also connected to another classmate named Louden , who is better known as Mouth . Scott tries every attempt to get Julia 's attention such as joining the school paper , because he thinks that she is part of the staff , only to discover that she has written only a single column for the paper . He then runs for student council , after finding out that Julia is also running as well , and wins a seat , only to find out that she has not won . Because of this , Scott resigns from his position on the student council . It turns out that a lot of other members also resigned including the president meaning Julia who happened to have the 2nd most amount of votes is now president . He also auditions for the school play and is selected as a member of the crew , thinking that Julia is also auditioning for the play . However , Julia has not been selected as a member of the cast or crew . Soon , a new girl named Lee arrives at school , who wears face pins and weird clothes , and has wildly colored hair . Both soon realize that they share the same interests , but he ca n't get past his crush on Julia . Scott suddenly has another `` friend '' named Wesley , a high school senior . Though they share some interests , they have little in common . Then to put the cherry on top of all this excitement going on in his life , his mother announces that she is pregnant . He copes with all of this by creating a tip book for his soon - to - be baby sibling to help him , or her , survive high school when they get to it . In his entries to the baby , he often shows disdain by using degrading terms to talk to it such as `` Smelly '' or `` Blob of unformed goo '' . But he writes it to be a good older brother to this new baby since Scott 's own brother was never very present . As time goes by , Scott tries to find his place , but he starts to lose his best friends . Mitch finds a girlfriend and soon forgets the group , Patrick moves to Texas , then to Japan , and Kyle joins the wrestling team and soon puts Scott down for having a crush on Julia . Soon , Julia 's boyfriend Vernon beats up Scott after finding out from Kyle ( who lost a fight with Scott ) that Scott has a crush on his girlfriend . Scott realizes that what a person says and does can affect the life of another after Mouth attempts to commit suicide . Later , he learns that not everything is what it seems once he finds out that his older brother , Bobby , who is struggling to find a job , can barely read . Scott 's mother eventually gives birth to a new baby boy , whom they name Sean . Meanwhile , Bobby finds a job through guitar - playing and Julia eventually starts dating a nicer guy , though she is now close to Scott enough to give him a kiss on the cheek .",

Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' . Today , kudzu is estimated to cover 3,000,000 hectares ( 7,400,000 acres ) of land in the southeastern United States , mostly in Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Florida , North Carolina , South Carolina and Mississippi .

Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world . The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a global whole with self - organizing tendencies . The assumed physiological mechanisms on which Gestalt theory rests are poorly defined and support for their existence is lacking . The Gestalt theory of perception has been criticized as being descriptive of the end products of perception without providing much insight into the processes that lead to perception . In the introduction to a 2016 special issue of the journal Vision Research on Gestalt perception , the authors concluded that `` even though they study the same phenomena as earlier Gestaltists , there is little theoretical coherence . What happened to the Gestalt school that always aspired to provide a unified vision of psychology ? Perhaps there is , in fact , little that holds the classic phenomena of Gestalt psychology together . ''",

Performances were generally held in open - air arenas , such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger , more elaborate performers or performances . The most notorious was `` Prof. Gentry 's Famous Dog & Pony Show , '' started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act , originally entitled `` Gentry 's Equine and Canine Paradox .

On June 8 , 2009 , Democrats Hiram Monserrate and Pedro Espada , Jr. , joined the 30 Republican members of the State Senate to attempt to issue a motion to replace current Majority Leader Malcolm Smith with Minority Leader Dean Skelos . Following the precedent of 1913 , the temporary presidency and the majority leadership would have been separated again under this scenario . Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer 's resignation , the majority leaders ( Bruno , Skelos and Smith ) have acted as lieutenant governors . The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate , which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor . The Democrats have disputed the legitimacy of the motions put forward on June 8 . The New York State Senate has been providing a running update of the legal proceedings since June 11 , 2009 . The dispute ended July 9 , 2009 , when Senator Espada announced he would return to the Democratic caucus and take on the position of majority leader , while it was also announced that former majority leader Malcolm Smith had assumed the title of president pro tempore , and John Sampson would serve as Democratic conference leader with the understanding he would assume the presidency at an undetermined future date . Following the 2010 election and the Republican victory in the Senate , Senator Dean Skelos from Long Island served as both Temporary President and Majority Leader , but resigned in May 2015 in the midst of corruption charges .

The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs , essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body . Unlike the CNS , the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood -- brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system , the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS . However , the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS . The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands . The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states : sympathetic and parasympathetic .",

In the late sixteenth century , Nurhaci , originally a Ming vassal , began organizing `` Banners '' , military - social units that included Jurchen , Han Chinese , and Mongol elements . Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity , which he renamed as the Manchus . By 1636 , his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the Qing . In 1644 , peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital , Beijing . Rather than serve them , Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized the capital . Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor ( r . 1661 -- 1722 ) . The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia . The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways , and while their title was Emperor , they used `` Bogd khaan '' to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism . They governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government and retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus .

            "paragraph": "Daenerys Targaryen ( season 1 -- present ) portrayed by Emilia Clarke . Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty . Also called `` the Stormborn '' , she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert 's Rebellion . For seventeen years , she has been under the care of Viserys , whom she fears , as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him . In exchange for an army , Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo , making her a Khaleesi , a queen of the Dothraki . Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language , she manages to get past their barriers . She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man . After embracing the Dothraki culture , she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother . She later becomes pregnant with Drogo 's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' . After her brother 's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon , Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son . However , during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman . Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic . Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son 's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo , leaving him in a permanent catatonic state , and forcing Daenerys to end her husband 's life . Losing both her husband and son , Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake . She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo 's body , then steps into the burning funeral pyre . After the fire extinguishes itself , the Khaleesi and three baby dragons , named Drogon , Rhaegal , and Viserion , are found alive and unharmed . Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne . She becomes the first female Dothraki leader . In Season 2 , she is lost in the Red Waste , a stretch of barren land . She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth , where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros . When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree , she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them , killing Pyat Pree . In the second season 's finale , she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree . Her horde loot Xaro 's mansion to buy a ship . Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor , a city in Slaver 's Bay , where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied . She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy , and accepts him into her queensguard . On her departure from the city , she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders . By the end of Season 3 , although her power has not yet been tested , she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai , her remaining Dothraki brethren ( and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki , who advise her ) 2,000 ' Second Sons ' cavalrymen , 8,000 ' Unsullied ' elite infantry , and three rapidly growing dragons . The stay in Slaver 's Bay has made her question her motives , however , and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well , donning the honorific `` Breaker of Chains '' as the slaves hold her to the sky , praising her as their Mhysa , or `` Mother '' . Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen , the last of the slave cities in Slaver 's Bay , but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons , especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food . Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet , Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver 's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being . She eventually learns of Jorah 's original purpose , which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon , and orders him to leave Meereen on threat of execution . After she receives too many complaints about her dragons , Daenerys , locks Rhaegal and Viserion of them in the catacombs beneath Meereen before searching for Drogon . Meanwhile , Daenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy , a resistance movement against her and the Unsullied . She considers freeing her dragons , but they attempt to attack her , making her realize that they are no longer loyal to her . After Daario and Grey Worm arrest a member of the Sons of the Harpy , Mossador implores Daenerys to execute their captive , but Barristan tells her of the Mad King 's actions against his enemies , which included burning them with wildfire while laughing . He asks her not to execute the captive without a fair trial , and she agrees with him . Mossador goes against her wishes , and kills the captive Son of the Harpy . Daenerys has him publicly executed , which leads a riot to break out between the old masters and the freed slaves . At night , Daenerys finds that Drogon has returned , but when she tries to touch his face , he flies away . Soon afterward , a group of Unsullied patrolling the streets of Meereen are stopped by a crying woman who points them to an alleyway . The Unsullied head in to investigate , but it is revealed that the entire affair was a set up after they are soon cornered by a group of the Sons of the Harpy . The Unsullied attempt to fight back , but the Sons of the Harpy kill many of them . Barristan Selmy sees the commotion and tries to help , killing many of the Sons of the Harpy , but gets badly wounded , and dies . Grey Worm also sustains serious but nonfatal injuries . Daenerys is furious after learning what has happened to Barristan , and rounds up the leaders of the great Meereenese houses . She takes them into the catacombs where she randomly has one of them shoved forward . The Meereenese lord is promptly killed by dragonfire from Rhaegal , and he and Viserion eat him . Daenerys then has all the lords arrested , including her former adviser Hizdahr zo Loraq , whom she decides to marry to win over the Meereenese nobles . To respect the culture of the region , she agrees to have the fighting pits reinstated ( she had previously declined due to her distaste for killing for sport ) . Hizdahr convinces Daenerys to go to one of the pits to see the contestants battling over who will go to the final competition . Daenerys is sickened by the bloodshed , and gets up to leave , but her attention is turned by one masked competitor who defeats all of the other competitors without killing any of them . This competitor turns out to be Jorah Mormont , who is trying to win over Daenerys ' favor after being banished . Daenerys orders the Unsullied to take him away , but Jorah announces that he has brought her a gift , and Tyrion Lannister reveals himself to Daenerys . After a round of questioning , Daenerys banishes Jorah once again , but takes Tyrion on as her adviser . On the great opening of Daznak 's Pit , Jorah resurfaces as a voluntary contender on the arena , but Daenerys refuses to stop the games to spare his life . Jorah eventually prevails and saves her life by impaling with his spear an attacker from the Sons of the Harpy , who appear in legions and attack Daenerys ' guards . Cornered at the midst of the arena , defeat seems immediate when Drogon returns , killing many Sons of the Harpy despite being wounded by several of their spears . Daenerys manages to rekindle their bond and climbs his back , riding off into the distance to a stunned crowd . She roams the Great Steppe north of the city , where Drogon seems reluctant to obey her commands or even hunt for food . Strolling about on her own , Daenerys is faced with an incoming Dothraki khalasar of great numbers , and after dropping a ring to the ground to leave a trail , she is surrounded . In season 6 , the Dothraki take her to Vaes Dothrak , where she identifies herself to Khal Moro as Drogo 's former wife . Out of respect for Dothraki traditions , they take Daenerys to join the Dosh Khaleen , which consisted of the wives of deceased khals . Daenerys refuses and instead burns the temple down with herself and all the khals still inside . She emerges unscathed , and the awed Dothraki accept her as their new leader . She returns to Meereen with her new army and destroys the slaver fleet assaulting the city with her dragons . In the aftermath , Daenerys meets with Theon and Yara Greyjoy , who offer their support for her claim so that they can overthrow their uncle Euron . Daenerys accepts their aid and secures help from the Reach and Dorne , names Tyrion as her hand , but breaks up with Daario , ordering him to stay behind and govern Slaver 's Bay in her absence . With her new army , Daenerys finally sets sail for Westeros . In Season 7 Daenerys finally uses her dragons in battle , annihilating a Lannister force and their baggage train with fire . Daenerys welcomes Jon Snow to Dragonstone , seeing him as a friend and ally , insisting that he bend the knee to her but exhibiting patience with his refusal . She believes his tales of white walkers and agrees to let him mine dragonglass ( obsidian ) from her land . When Jon 's expedition north of the Wall gets into trouble Daenerys takes her dragons to rescue them , and is devastated when the Night King kills one . On the ship back to Dragonstone she and Jon make love .",

The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in this ensemble . Also , public concerts became a key part of urban middle class society , in contrast to earlier periods , when concerts were mainly paid for by and performed for aristocrats . Famous composers from the second half of the century include Bruckner , Johann Strauss II , Brahms , Liszt , Tchaikovsky , Dvo\u0159\u00e1k , Verdi , and Wagner . Between 1890 and 1910 , a third wave of composers including Mahler , Richard Strauss , Puccini , and Sibelius built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex -- and often much longer -- musical works . A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor , as exemplified by such figures as Dvo\u0159\u00e1k , Sibelius , and Grieg .

However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water , without which they are impractical . The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040 -- 2069 .

The assassins ' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia . The assassination led directly to the First World War when Austria - Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia , which was partially rejected . Austria - Hungary then declared war , triggering actions leading to war between most European states .",

            "paragraph": "By 2004 , 58 receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) were known , grouped into 20 subfamilies . They play pivotal roles in diverse cellular activities including growth ( by signaling neurotrophins ) , differentiation , metabolism , adhesion , motility , death . RTKs are composed of an extracellular domain , which is able to bind a specific ligand , a transmembrane domain , and an intracellular catalytic domain , which is able to bind and phosphorylate selected substrates . Binding of a ligand to the extracellular region causes a series of structural rearrangements in the RTK that lead to its enzymatic activation . In particular , movement of some parts of the kinase domain gives free access to adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and the substrate to the active site . This triggers a cascade of events through phosphorylation of intracellular proteins that ultimately transmit ( `` transduce '' ) the extracellular signal to the nucleus , causing changes in gene expression . Many RTKs are involved in oncogenesis , either by gene mutation , or chromosome translocation , or simply by over-expression . In every case , the result is a hyper - active kinase , that confers an aberrant , ligand - independent , non-regulated growth stimulus to the cancer cells .",

During Meredith 's morphine rampage , Mark finds out about his nickname McSteamy which was given to him by her during his first trip to Seattle back when he attempted to get Addison back and earn Derek 's friendship back . It is later revealed that Mark has at some point slept with all of Derek 's sisters . Mark has a brief fling with Addison 's friend , orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) , and develops a friendship with Derek 's girlfriend , intern Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) . It is revealed that after Derek left New York , Mark and Addison continued their relationship for two months , during which she conceived and aborted his child . Just weeks after moving to Seattle he quickly observes that Derek 's true love was Meredith and tries to convince Addison that her marriage with Derek was over . Mark enters into a sixty - day abstinence pact with Addison , agreeing that if they can remain celibate for that time , Addison will give their relationship another chance . Addison ultimately breaks the pact by having sex with intern Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) , and soon thereafter departs from Seattle to work in Los Angeles .",

A stylus responding to sound vibrations produced an up and down or hill - and - dale groove in the foil . Alexander Graham Bell 's Volta Laboratory made several improvements in the 1880s and introduced the graphophone , including the use of wax - coated cardboard cylinders and a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a zig zag groove around the record . In the 1890s , Emile Berliner initiated the transition from phonograph cylinders to flat discs with a spiral groove running from the periphery to near the center , coining the term gramophone for disc record players , which is predominantly used in many languages .
