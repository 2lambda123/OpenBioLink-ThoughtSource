## ThoughtSourceâš¡ Annotator

A web application to visualise and evaluate generated chains of thought. It works standalone, and is optionally enhanced with sentence similarity visualisations when running the backend flask server.

Prerequisites are a nodeJS installation, and installing all project dependencies (by running "npm install").

The annotator can be started by going to the folder (/apps/annotator) running from the command line:

```
npm start
```

A local host should then open in your active internet browser, and the application should be running.

A .env file is needed for configuration, containing values for REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL and REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL (URL of the react- and flask applications, respectively).

An example configuration "example.env" can be found in the project root. In a localhost development environment, the contents of example.env can be used as is.
